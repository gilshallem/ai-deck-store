  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 29/05/2025</p>

  <p>Your privacy is important to us. This application (‚Äúthe App‚Äù) is designed with your privacy in mind. We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal data from users. All operations are executed locally on your device or via services you explicitly configure.</p>

  <h2>üîí What We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Nothing.</strong><br>
  The App does not collect or transmit any user data. We do not track your usage, store your prompts, or access any files or personal information.</p>

  <h2>üîó Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App integrates with external AI services, including but not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>OpenAI (ChatGPT)</li>
    <li>Google (Gemini)</li>
    <li>Anthropic (Claude AI)</li>
    <li>DeepSeek</li>
    <li>Other API-based services</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To use these services, <strong>you must provide your own API keys</strong>. These keys are stored locally on your device and never sent to our servers (we don‚Äôt have any).</p>
  <p>Note: these third-party services may collect data according to their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any service you connect to through the App.</p>

  <h2>‚öôÔ∏è Local Operations</h2>
  <p>All features such as prompt shortcuts, context-aware actions, and extensions run entirely on your device. No data leaves your system unless explicitly sent by you to a third-party API.</p>

  <h2>üì± Permissions & Integrations</h2>
  <p>The App may request certain permissions (e.g., clipboard access, global shortcuts, file system access) <strong>only</strong> to provide its core functionality. These permissions are never used for data collection or transmission.</p>
